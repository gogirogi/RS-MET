  // We investigate the importance of representing the unwrapped phase not merely by a double
  // variable but by a double for the argument and an integer k that tells in which cycle we are.
  // The unwrapped phase is pu = p + 2*pi*k for some integer k where p is the actual argument (for 
  // the sine function) and k gives us the cycle in which we are. Using just a double variable for 
  // pu would lead to precision loss if k is large, so it is advidable to represent the phase by 
  // the pair (p,k) instead of just the single value pu. In this experiment we create a sinusoid 
  // once using the (p,k) representation for the unwrapped phase (which means we give just p as 
  // argument to the sine function) and using pu as argument for the sine function. As the effect 
  // becomes more pronounce for high k, we start at some start value k0.

  // With a samplerate of 96kHz, a sinusoid of 20kHz and a start-time (in samples) of a million
  // (i.e. around 10 seconds into the signal), the error is of the order of 1.e-7 and thus, 
  // significantly larger than the machine epsilon. Moreover, we didn't even consider the actual
  // phase error but rather the error in the resynthesized signal (i guess, the actual phase error
  // might be larger than that). So, it seems indeed a good idea to represent phase with a wrapped
  // argument and an integer k that gives the cycle.

Experiment with different window versions: symmetric (w[0]==w[N-1]), periodic (w[1]==w[N-1])
I think, the periodic one produces a little error in the computed phase (maybe also magnitude) but is
better suited for perfect reconstruction (overlapped windows add up to a constant, for properly chosen
shape and hopsize). Perhaps, the periodic version should be used in a blocked overlap/add FFT 
analysis/resynthesis scheme, but when oscillator bank resynthesis is used, symmetric windows might be 
preferable, due to less error in the analysis data (thes are all hypotheses that need to be checked
experimentally)

We could use symmetric windows (that start and end either with a zero or nonzero sample) and increase
or decrease the hopsize by one sample in order to achieve the desired periodicity. if both ends are 
nonzero, increase, if both are zero, decrease. this could solve the symmetry issue.



Experiment with the following test signals:

synthetic signals:
DC, impulses, sines of various frequencies, mixes of sine waves, sweeping sines (and mixes thereof, 
also simultaneous up- and downward sweeps that cross each other), noise, saw, saw sweeps, chords, 
sines + impulses (to observe time- and frequency localized signals simultaneously), damped sines,
filter sweeps

natural sounds (roughly ascending complexity): 
tonal instrument samples (steady and impulsive), drum/percussion samples, 
solo instrument performances, speaking and singing voice, drumloops, full (mastered) mixdowns of 
different musical genres

Ideas:
In order to match the analysis blocksize to the periodicity of the signal, the signal can be 
autotuned to a fixed period. For example, if the fundamental is around 440 Hz, corresponding to 
roughly 100 samples at 44.1 kHz samplerate, the period could be autotuned to 128 samples and the 
phase-vocoder would use a blocksize of some multiple of 128. Or we could fix the analysis 
blocksize to, say, 512 and tune the period to 512/3 such that each block contains 3 cycles.


Miscelleneous remarks:
-When we reynthesize a signal with the overlap/add procedure, we have to a apply a global gain 
 inverse to summed (overlapped) products of the anylysis and synthesi windows. If these sum up to a
 constant, i think, the gain can be calculated as:
 g = 0;
 for(i = 0; i < B; i++)
   g += wa[i] * ws[i];
 where  B: blocksize, H: hopsize, wa: analysis window, ws: synthesis window. The inverse of this 
 computed g value is the desired gain to be applied

Seperation of sinusoids: For a spectrogram value s(j, k) where j is the frame index and k is the 
bin index, a sinusoid will satisfy some constraints for how the s(j, k) relates to its local
neighbourhood. The horizontal constraints depend of the overlap factor (defined as (B-H)/B) and the
vertical constraints depend on the window-shape and zero-padding factor. These constraints tighten
as the overlap or zero-padding increases, respectively - so any decision function that separates
sinusoids should take these parameters into account. The vertical constraints also tighten with
increasing mainlobe-width of the window.
vertical constraints:
-not a minimum: s(j, k) >= s(j, k-1), s(j, k) >= s(j, k+1), but it's not necessarily a maximum 
 because a sinuosid spreads over several bins
-a sinusoid in the freqeuncy domain looks like the transform of the window, so maybe a 
 pattern-matching algorithm can be used -> cross-correlate STFT spectrum with the window transform, 
 maybe only with the mainlobe, but i think, it's not valid to just crosscorrelate the magnitudes
-2D-crosscorrelate similarity with image-processing kernels that correspond to sinusoids, width 
 depends on overlap, height on zero-padding
-compare forward and backward instantaneous frequency estimate (should be similar for sines)
 -maybe we can also use the reassigned frequency values (and maybe also their time reassignments)
-bandpass-filter horizontal lines with the expected modulation frequency for the respective bin 
 (real and imaginary parts are expected to undulate with a frequency characteristic for each bin)
-maybe to modify the spectrogram values, compute an expected value from the neighbouhood for 
 magnitude and phase and the do a weighted sum of actual and expected value (weights should add
 up to unity)
-for experimentation, we should at various cases. stable sinusoid, sweeping amplitude, sweeping 
 frequency, both is sweeping - we may derive
-maybe make use of the time/frequency reassignment values
-there are (at least) 3 ways to determine an instantaneous frequency: phase-differences of 
 successive frames, frequency-reassignment, parabolic magnitude interpolation - maybe the decision,
 whether a pixel (time/frequency point) belongs to a sinusoid can be based on how much these 
 different values agree.
 -the most efficient would be to compare magnitude-interpolation values to phase-difference values
  because no additional FFTs are needed
 -other ideas for finding a frequency: parabolic interpolation of autocorrelation sequence
-if a spectral peak is considered sinusoidal, we should automatically assume some neighbouring peaks
 to belong to that sinuosid, too - based on the spectral width of the FFT of the analysis window
-deviatograms: idea: if there's a stable sinusoid, we could compute an expected value for each 
 pixel based on neighborhood pixels - the (absolute or squared) difference between the expected and
 actual value is called the "deviation". plotting the deviation for each pixel gives the
 "deviatogram". for example, for a magnitude deviatogram, we could define the expected magnitude 
 value se(j, k) = (s(j-1, k) + s(j+1, k)) / 2. this is the mean of the left and right neighbour's
 magnitude and implies an assumed linear amplitude envelope. for an assumption of an exponential
 envelope, we could use the geometric mean. we could also assume that ascension are linear and 
 decays exponential by using geometric mean if s(j-1) > s(j+1), else use arithmetic mean (should
 be used only for impulsive sounds)
